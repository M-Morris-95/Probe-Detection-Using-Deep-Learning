run file 'run_model.py' to generate predictions using trained model

need to set on lines 11 and 12
IMAGES_ROOT = 'probe_dataset/probe_images'  # this is where your pictures are saved
MODEL = 'VGG'                               # this is the model you want to run, either "VGG" or "mobilenet"

It will save a file 'my_predictions.json' which contains all the predictions in the same format as they were given.


code.ipynb is the development environment and shows all the steps including hyper parameter tuning.
metrics.py is where MAP and IoU are calculated. 
model_functions.py contains the model definition and code to make predictions
